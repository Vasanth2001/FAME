# FAME
The project addresses encryption efficiency challenges, facilitating broader adoption of ABE in applications requiring precise access management based on user attributes and data characteristics

# Introduction
This project focuses on Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) as a cryptographic tool for building robust conditional access systems. ABE offers the capability to enforce access control policies based on attributes of users or data, providing flexibility and security in data management. Despite its potential, widespread deployment has been hindered by inefficiencies in existing encryption schemes.

# Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to propose and implement fully secure ciphertext-policy and key-policy ABE schemes based on Type-III pairing groups. These schemes aim to overcome limitations in previous approaches by offering efficiency and flexibility without restricting policy types or attributes.

# Key Features
Enhanced Security: Utilizing Type-III pairing groups ensures robust security without compromising on performance.

Flexibility in Access Control: Supports both ciphertext-policy and key-policy ABE schemes, accommodating diverse access control requirements.

Efficient Encryption: The proposed schemes are designed to operate efficiently on sensitive data, optimizing performance across various parameters.

# Implementation
The project implements the proposed ABE schemes using the Charm cryptographic library. Comparative analysis with existing prominent ABE schemes demonstrates superior performance in terms of efficiency and practical usability.

# Project Structure
Research and Development: Conducting theoretical research on Type-III pairing groups and ABE schemes.

Scheme Implementation: Coding and integrating the ABE schemes using the Charm library.

Performance Evaluation: Benchmarking the implemented schemes against other notable ABE schemes to assess efficiency and effectiveness.

# Conclusion
This project contributes to advancing the deployment of ABE in real-world applications by addressing key challenges in encryption efficiency and flexibility. By implementing and validating these schemes using the Charm library, the project aims to provide a practical framework for secure and scalable conditional access systems based on Attribute-Based Encryption.
